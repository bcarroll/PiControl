# PiControl
###### Raspberry Pi Control Center

***
## Installation
1. Download the code
    * git clone https://github.com/bcarroll/PiControl.git
    * [Download the repository as a zip file](https://github.com/bcarroll/PiControl/archive/master.zip)
2. Install Operating System dependencies (mostly for SSL support)
    *    ``sudo apt-get update``
    *    ``sudo apt-get install gcc libffi-dev libssl-dev python-dev python-cryptography``
3. Install Python dependencies
    *    ``cd /directory/where/you/cloned-or_unzipped``
    *    ``sudo pip install -r requirements.txt``
        If the pip install command generates errors you can try installing the module dependencies manually:
        ``sudo pip install asn1crypto cffi click cryptography enum34 Flask Flask-SSLify idna ipaddress itsdangerous MarkupSafe netifaces psutil pycparser pyOpenSSL simplepam six wiringpi``
4.    *Optional* - Start PiControl when your Raspberry Pi boots
    *    ``echo sudo -u pi python /directory/where/you/cloned-or_unzipped/PiControl.py & >> /etc/rc.local``

    The above command adds a new line to /etc/rc.local which will start PiControl as the "pi" user when the Raspberry Pi boots.
    If you remove the "sudo -u pi" part, PiControl will run as "root" (not advised, for security reasons).
    You can also create a new account to run PiControl as with the [adduser](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/users.md) command.

5.    Start PiControl
    *    ``sudo -u pi python /directory/where/you/cloned-or_unzipped/PiControl.py &``

     The ampersand at the end of the command string is important if you want PiControl to remain running once you logout.
     Without the ampersand, PiControl will be killed when the shell is terminated.

## Usage
Once you have PiControl installed and running, open a web browser *(either on the Pi itself or another machine (or smartphone) that can communication with the Pi)*

In the web browser, goto **https://ipaddress_of_your_pi:31415**

If you are using a web browser from a UNIX-ish machine (Linux, UNIX, MacOS) and you know the hostname of your Pi, you can access PiControl via **https://hostname.local:31415** (replace "hostname" in the URL with your Pi's actual hostname)

#### *Notice:*
**You will be presented with an SSL Security Error/Warning, because PiControl, by default, uses a self-signed SSL certificate, and your browser doesn't trust self signed certificates.  PiControl uses SSL to make sure the data that is transmitted is encrypted.  To get arounf the certificate error, the web browser will let you add an exception for the URL so the SSL error is not displayed the next time you visit the URL.**

If you do not want to use the included self-signed certificate, you can replace SSL/server.crt and SSL/server.key with a commercial SSL certificate. *- If this applies to you, you probably now how to make that happen.*

Once you get past the SSL warning screen, you will be presented with the PiControl login interface.  Login using your Raspberry Pi credential ("pi") and password.

Login with a valid OS user account (pi)

![PiControl - Main](https://bcarroll.github.io/PiControl/Main_sm.png "PiControl Main screen")

The main screen displays the hostname of your Raspberry Pi in the upper left, a picture of the hardware on the upper right and the Raspberry Pi Model information and hardware details.

The menubar on the left side of the screen allows you to view/control various aspects of your  Raspberry Pi.
